==================
== REQUIREMENTS ==
==================

CSI-UTR requires the following:
samtools
BedTools (v2.24.0 or later) (https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2)
perl (5.12.13 or later)
R 

In addition, a number of perl packages are required, including:
List::MoreUtils                                   : 0.33
Getopt::Long                                      : 2.38
MIME::Base64                                      : 3.08
Statistics::TTest                                 : 1.1
Text::NSP::Measures::2D::Fisher::twotailed        : 0.97
Statistics::Multtest                              : 0.13
File::Which                                       : 1.09

Required R libraries inlcude:
DESeq2
DEXSeq

Please run the file checkDependencies to make sure all of the required packages are available
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


========================
== INSTALLING CSI-UTR ==
========================
CSI-UTR is distributed as a tarball.  
In order to unpack the files, run: tar xvf CSI-UTR.tar.gz
This will create a CSI-UTR_vx.x.x directory. Inside this directory is an executable file
checkDependencies that should be run to ensure that perl, and all of the perl packages are installed.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================
== DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ==
=========================
bin/			Location of CSI-UTR executabel
data/annotations	Annotated CSI BED files for Rat, Mouse, Human	
data/locations		CSI BED location files for Rat, Mouse, Human
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


========================
== SETTING UP CSI-UTR ==
========================
In order to run CSI-UTR, you will need to provide two sets of input.  The first is a set of high-throughput
sequence alignments in .bam format, located in a user-specified data directory (current directory by default).  
Index bam files are required.  if .bam.bai files are missing, the .bam files will be sorted and indexed using samtools.

It is recommended that this bam file be parsed to contain only uniquely mapped reads.

The second piece of information is a file sampleInformation.txt

This file is a tab-delimited file containing the following information:
FilePrefix	ConditionLabel	ReplicateNumber

In this case, the data is set up as follows:
   FilePrefix is the name of the .bam files, minus the .bam extension
   ConditionLabel is used to group samples together
   ReplicateNumber is the replicate number for the specified group

an example sampleInformation.txt file is provided.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=====================
== RUNNING CSI-UTR ==
=====================
From the CSI-UTR home directory, run the executable perl script:
./bin/CSI-UTR with the following options:

   options:
      -genome=<genome>                    (default: Rn6 -- Other options are Mm10, Hg38, Rn6_extended)
      -r=<read_length>                    (default: 75)
      -sample_info=<sample_info_table_fn> (default: sampleInformaton.txt)
      -bed=<CSI_bed_file>                 (default: ./data/locations/Rn6.CSIs.bed)
      -annot=<CSI_annotation_file>        (default: ./data/annotations/Rn6.CSIs.annot.bed)
      -out=<output directory>             (default: ./CSI_OUT/)
      -data_dir=<input directory>         (default: ./)
      -coverage_cut=<coverage cutoff>     (default: 0.08)
      -usage_cut=<usage cutoff>           (default: 1.0)
      -p=<p value significance cutoff)    (default: 0.05)
      -q=<FDR significance cutoff)        (default: 0.10)

      --h Print this help screen
      --v Print version information

Within the output directory, a DifferentialExpression directory will be created with two sub-directories:
PAIRWISE   (pairwise comparision between each group represented)
WITHIN_UTR (compares expression within individual CSIs for differential UTR expression)
DEXSeq     (compares CSI usage using the DEXSeq and DESeq2 method for exon usage)
